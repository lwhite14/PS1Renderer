# FirstPersonRenderPipeline
Render pipeline for rendering a first person scene using OpenGL.

### Getting started
To run the source code, you are going to need the dependancies for [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html), [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html), and [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/). You will need to link these dependancies in the VS properties, and add the glad.c file generated to the project.
